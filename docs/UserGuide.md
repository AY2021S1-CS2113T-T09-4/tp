## Create


### Creating a new user profile

If this is your first time using **tracKCAL**, you will be automatically prompted to create a user profile and there is no need for you to input any command.
**tracKCAL** will then use these details from your user profile to calculate the following: 

* BMI
* Recommended daily calorie
* Calorie goal to reach weight goal

>However, if you want to create a new profile for an existing user, you will need to use this command

Format: `create new user`

Example of usage:

```
Hey there! We do not have a record of your profile. Please create one now! :)

What is your name?
**Sam**
What is your gender (male/female)?
**female**
What is your weight in kg?
**50**
What is your height in cm?
**100**
What is your age?
**10**
How active are you on a scale of 1-5? With 1 being least active and 5 being most active.
**4**
Do you want to lose/maintain/gain weight?
**gain**

Your BMI is 50.0
Your recommend daily calories intake is 1576.65 calories.
To gain weight, you should consume 2076.65 calories instead.
